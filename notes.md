# Notes for Angular vids

## 2.1 Components
    - Angular works in components, which function like nodes in a DOM tree    
    - These components dynamically change the DOM using template functions
    - Components can be nested.

## 2.2 Directives and Pipes
    - An Angular component is actually a **directive** with a template
    - Directives provide functionality and can transform the DOM
        1. **Structural Directives:** modify layout by altering elements in the DOM
        2. **Attribute Directives:** change the behavior or appearance of an existing DOM element
    - **Angular Pipe:** Takes in data (like a string or array) and runs logic to transform it to a new output
        - i.e. "some logic" --> "SOME LOGIC"

## 2.3 Data binding
    - this is too complicated :|
